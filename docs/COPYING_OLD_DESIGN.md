# Copying Old Website Design

## Status: In Progress

I'm copying the better design from the old website. Here's what's been done:

### ✅ Completed
1. ✅ Copied CSS styling (dark theme, cards, buttons)
2. ✅ Updated Tailwind config with old theme (doge colors, animations)
3. ✅ Copied BackgroundRippleEffect component
4. ✅ Installed react-dropzone and react-hot-toast
5. ✅ Copied assets (wizarddog.gif, bg.png)

### 🔄 Next Steps
1. Update Home page to use old design (wizard dog GIF, hero section, form layout)
2. Create/adapt DragDropUpload component (or adapt UploadForm)
3. Ensure components work with new API structure
4. Keep mobile optimizations we already added

The old design is much better - dark theme, wizard dog mascot, better visual hierarchy!
